# ERP Analysis: Decoding Brain Responses to Finger Movements

This project analyzes Event-Related Potentials (ERP) to study the brain's response to finger movements. Using ECoG data and finger movement events, it computes and visualizes mean brain responses, providing insights into neural dynamics during motor tasks.

## Features
- Extracts brain signal slices (200 ms pre-event to 1000 ms post-event) for each finger.
- Computes and visualizes mean Event-Related Potentials (ERP) for all fingers.
- Demonstrates advanced signal processing and data visualization techniques.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
